# Fharhan Amrin's Website

Hi, I'm Fharhan. This is my personal website, where I share my projects, my journey, and my information.

I am a **software engineer** with more than 6 years of experience. I love to **write codes** and **explore new things**. I really enjoy making web application, particularly in the frontend. It's like being the architect and artist of the online world.
